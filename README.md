# Overview

Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Streamlit App! This application uses machine learning models to predict the risk of stroke based on user-inputted health parameters. The app is built using Streamlit and is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for medical professionals and patients to assess stroke risk.

# Features

- **Interactive User Input**: Users can input their health parameters such as age, gender, BMI, glucose level, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers for prediction.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Displays accuracy, ROC AUC scores, and confusion matrices for the models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations for data distribution and feature correlations.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the app [here](https://strokeriskprediction.streamlit.app).

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser using the URL provided above.
2. Enter your health parameters in the sidebar.
3. View the predicted stroke risk and explore model performance metrics and data visualizations.

## Dataset
This project uses the [Stroke Prediction Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data) provided by Federico Soriano. The dataset contains various health parameters necessary for predicting stroke occurrences.
